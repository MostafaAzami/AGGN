# AGGN: Augmented Gradient-Guided Network for Few-Shot Regression

## Overview
Few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial area of research in machine learning due to its ability to generalize from a limited number of examples. While most research in this domain has focused on classification problems, fewer works have explored few-shot regression. This project introduces **AGGN (Augmented Gradient-Guided Network)**, a novel approach to few-shot regression that utilizes a differentiable reference function and a gradient-guided data augmentation strategy.

## Key Features
- **Differentiable Reference Function**: Guides learning by ensuring the model aligns with predefined gradient information.
- **Gradient-Guided Data Augmentation**: Generates additional training samples based on gradient information to improve model robustness.
- **Hybrid Training Strategy**: Updates model parameters by leveraging real data, augmented data, and the reference function.
- **Superior Performance**: Demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.


## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
